# cribbage
coding cribbage for the casual computer-carrying colleague

----
To play:
1. get 6 files (Card.java, Crib.java, Cribbage.java, CribbageClient.java, Deck.java, Hand.java) into a package "cribbage"
2. play by running Cribbage.java
(you will want your terminal to be about 10 lines long for peak playing)
